# Executor Configuration
# NOTE: Executor HAS Vault access - it's the only component that does
#
# SECURITY: No cryptographic signature verification needed.
# Network isolation ensures only NPL can reach this service:
# - Docker: Executor not exposed to host network
# - Kubernetes: NetworkPolicy restricts ingress to NPL only
