# Party Automation Rules for MCP Gateway
#
# Maps JWT claims to NPL protocol parties.
# Party names use 'p' prefix to distinguish from JWT claim roles.
#
# Hierarchy:
# - pAdmin: Organization administrators (policy management)
# - pGateway: Gateway system service (runtime policy enforcement)
#
# Note: Tool users (humans and AI) are NOT parties. They're governed by
# grants inside the PolicyStore singleton, identified by subjectId.
